Package: outlgpg
Contact: outl@g10code.com

This is a plugin for MS Outlook, formerly known as the G-DATA plugin.
There has been no development on this tool for a couple of years and
thus we started to rewrite it from scratch.


.          Top directory with build scripts and information files.

src/       Code to build the actual core of the plugin.  The resulting
           DLL will be named "outlgpg.dll".  It is to build using
           the Mingw toolchain.

bin/       Precompiled binaries.



Note: For building in src/ you need to throw an orginal mapi32.dll
into this directory.  This is due to a bug in the binutiuls: ld is not
able to properly read an DEF file but will happily use the same
information from an actual DLL.  The problem is that symbols like
HrSetOneProp@8 are actually written without the "@8" into the import
table when used with a DEF file and generated import lib.  Needs more
debugging - any BFD cracks who can lend me a helping hand?  (wk).
