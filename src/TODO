* Show more details in case of some errors.
  For example 'No Secret Key' should contain the key-ID
  and if possible the primary user-ID.

* much better HTML support.

* factor out more common code in encrypt, signEncrypt.

* grep all XXX in the code and provide fixes.

* provide a general passphrase caching system to allow to store
  more than one passphrase. This can be done with a hash table and
  the key-ID is used as the index to access the passphrase.

* handle unicode messages and find out why UTF-8 messages cannot be
  manipulated.

* find out why sometimes the new body cannot set to a MAPI object. In
  this case the body is empty but the W32 API said it was correctly set.

* implement a static shared section inside the DLL to provide the key cache
  objects. right now we load all keys on demand.
