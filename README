Package: outlgpg
Contact: outl@g10code.com

This is a plugin for MS Outlook, also known as the G-DATA plugin.  There has
been no development on this tool for a couple of years and thus we started
to revamp it a bit.

- the gdgpg subfolder contains the source of the G-DATA
  COM object. (The program is now obsolete!)

- the gpgexch subfolder contains the source of the G-DATA
  Outlook plugin. (The program is now obsolete!)

- the outlgpg subfolder contains the source of the new Outlook
  plugin.
  
- the w32dlgs subfolder contains the framework for all mail plugins.
