           DLL will be named "gpgol.dll".  It is to be build using

To install this plugin, copy "gpgol.dll" to some directory (e.g. where
gpg lives), make sure that the libgpg-error.dll and gpgme.dll are
available in a directory where Windows searches for DLLs
(e.g. c:\winnt\system32), stop Outlook, run the command "regsvr32
gpgol.dll" and start Outlook. You should then find a new tab named
"GnuPG" in Outlook's option menu.

If you are missing icons in the toolbar, checkout the toolbar's
customize button - you will find the new icons there.
