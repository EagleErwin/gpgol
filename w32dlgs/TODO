
* provide a general passphrase caching system to allow to store
  more than one passphrase. This can be done with a hash table and
  the key-ID is used as the index to access the passphrase.

* process attachments and encrypt them. find a way to offer decryption
  of the attachments and to save them somewhere.
  it would be better to add a new item to the context menu
  'decrypt and save as...'.

* handle unicode messages and find out why UTF-8 messages cannot be
  manipulated.

* find out why sometimes the new body cannot set to a MAPI object. In
  this case the body is empty but the W32 API said it was correctly set.

* implement a static shared section inside the DLL to provide the key cache
  objects. right now we load all keys on demand.
