This is a plugin for MS Outlook, also known as the G-DATA plugin.  There has
been no development on this tool for a couple of years and thus we started
to revamp it a bit.

- the gdgpg subfolder contains the source of the G-DATA
  COM object.

- the gpgexch subfolder contains the source of the G-DATA
  Outlook plugin.
