
                GPGME Dialogs
                =============

This project is a framework around GPGME to provide uniform dialogs
for common GPG operations and a uniform interface to access the core
functions.


Furthermore it contains a class for wrapping MAPI objects. It can be
used to make the encryption/decryption of mails easier. Since version
0.5.5 it is possible to secure attachments also.
