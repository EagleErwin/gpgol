Installation Instructions for GpgOL
***********************************

GpgOL is to be cross compile for Windows on a GNU/Linux system.
And then deployed on Windows.

The tested development platform is debian stable.

Dependencies
============

GpgOL depends on the GnuPG libraries libassuan, libgpgme and libgpg-error
it further needs a recent mingw-w64 gcc.

For debian this would be the packages:

gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
gcc-mingw-w64-i686

A convenience build setting is provided by gpgol and the dependency libraries
to configure a cross compile for windows with ./autogen.sh --build-w32 or
./autogen.sh --build-w64

The installation prefix will be ~/w32root or ~/w64root you can
override this by setting the environment variables w32root or w64root.

Example build from git:

PROJECTS="libgpg-error libassuan gpgme"
root=$(mktemp -d)
for proj in $PROJECTS; do
    cd $root
    git clone --depth 1 --branch master git://git.gnupg.org/${proj}.git
    cd $proj
    ./autogen.sh
    mkdir build-w32
    cd build-w32
    ../autogen.sh --build-w32
    make -j`nproc`
    make install
done

GpgOL Build
===========

Similarly you can use the --build-w32 option in gpgol

./autogen.sh
mkdir build-w32
cd build-w32
../autogen.sh --build-w32
make -j`nproc`

Under src/gpgol.dll you then have the binary that you
can deploy on Windows. See README for instructions on that.
