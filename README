This is a plugin for MS Outlook, formerly known as the G-DATA plugin.
There has been no development on this tool for a couple of years and

olflange/  Code to build "gpgolfla.dll".  This DLL used to connect the
           actual plugin to Outlook.  This is expected not to change
           too often.  Special tools (read: a native MS Windows
           compiler) is required to build it.
