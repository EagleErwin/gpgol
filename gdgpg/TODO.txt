TODO list for version 1.2.0. This should be the first stable version.

	* GetDefaultKey: Do not get the first, but the first valid key.
	This is a little tricky due to the fact that --list-secret-keys
	does not output any key status information.

	* Check indent level to make the code more readable.

	* Support for the OpenPGP smart card.

	* Collect all bug report and provide bug fixes for them.	

	* Check for buffer overflow. In some cases strings are copied
	without any bound checking.

	* Implement PGP/MIME (RFC3156).

	* Find a better way for the translation issues.

	* Make a public release and search for a new maintainer.
