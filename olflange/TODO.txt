Problems with the current version
=================================

- If the mail uses UTF-8 as the charset, it is not possible to set the
  PR_BODY property. Thus the mail text is read-only and the plugin failes
  to show the decrypted message body.

- Another UTF-8 problem: if the mail has this charset, the temporary files
  cannot be deleted. DeleteFile() returns true but the file remains on diesk.

- After an update the LogFile file contains invalid data.
  (Fixme:  is this still true for 0.94?)
