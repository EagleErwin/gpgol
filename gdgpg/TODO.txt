TODO list for version 1.3.0. This should be the first stable version.

GDGPG interface:

	* GetDefaultKey: Do not get the first, but the first valid key.
	This is a little tricky due to the fact that --list-secret-keys
	does not output any key status information.

	* Check indent level to make the code more readable.

	* Support for the OpenPGP smart card.

	* Collect all bug report and provide bug fixes for them.	

	* Check for buffer overflow. In some cases strings are copied
	without any bound checking.

	* Implement PGP/MIME (RFC3156).

	* Find a better way for the translation issues.

g10Code interface:
	
	* Add some regression tests to check if the code works with
 	all combinations of options.

	* Replace the generic string handling which a more advanced
	data type.

	* Add the rest of the core GPG functions.
